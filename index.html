<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>In a normal Active Directory environment permissions to resources are controlled by groups and their membership. Simply speaking, a user member of a particular group has permission to a particular resource. 
If a user needs access to a resource the IT department will be contacted which then fulfills the request. </p>

<p>In a small environment it only takes a few steps. In bigger companies the it might take several steps more to solve a user's request (Ticket processing, approval handling, etc.).</p>

<p>This tool helps out. It gives a user a way to update the membership of a group that she is been trusted in 3 steps without contacting IT. - Time saving for the user and for the IT department!</p>

<a id="from-users-perspective" class="anchor" href="#from-users-perspective" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>From user's perspective</h2>

<ol>
<li>A user opens Internet Explorer and navigates to the URL under which the tool has been published. E.g. <a href="http://groupmanagementtool">http://groupmanagementtool</a>. The user will be authenticated through windows authentication without keying in password and sees directly which groups she is able to manage:</li>
</ol>

<p>Members of the first group will be shown automatically. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Members can be deleted by selecting and choosing the delete link. Alternatively new users can be added to the group by typing in a few characters of the new user's name or UserID and adding him with the add-link:</p></li>
<li><p>Last the changes must be committed by clicking the updated-membership link:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A status message will inform if the action succeeded or failed.</p>

<p>As 'goody' the pint link on the top of the page will sent the group membership of the present displayed group to the user.</p>

<h2>
<a id="from-its-perspective" class="anchor" href="#from-its-perspective" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>From IT's perspective</h2>
