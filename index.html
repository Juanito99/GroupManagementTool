<a id="welcome-to-group-management-tool" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-group-management-tool" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Group Management Tool</h3>

<p>This free self service portal provides your users in Active Directory an easy way to manage 'their' groups.
Only 3 steps are required to maintain group members. </p>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7899811/a31245e8-0765-11e5-839c-86c0fbdfaadb.png" alt="MainScreen"></p>

<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>In a normal Active Directory environment permissions to resources are controlled by groups and their membership. Simply speaking, a user member of a particular group has permission to a particular resource. 
If a user needs access to a resource the IT department will be contacted which then fulfills the request. </p>

<p>In a small environment it only takes a few steps. In bigger companies the it might take several steps more to solve a user's request (Ticket processing, approval handling, etc.).</p>

<p>This tool helps out. It gives a user a way to update the membership of a group that she is been trusted in 3 steps without contacting IT. - Time saving for the user and for the IT department!</p>

<a id="from-users-perspective" class="anchor" href="#from-users-perspective" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>From user's perspective</h2>

<p>A user opens Internet Explorer and navigates to the URL under which the tool has been published. E.g. <a href="http://adgmt">http://adgmt</a>. The user will be authenticated through windows authentication without keying in password and sees directly which groups she is able to manage:

<p>Members of the first group will be shown automatically:

<p>Members can be deleted by selecting and choosing the delete link. New users can be added to the group by typing in a few characters of the new user's name or UserID and adding him with the add-link:

<p>The software is build in ASP.Net WebForms and requires .Net 4.5.1 framework running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 or higher. 
The server hosting the page must be part of Active Directory. Only Internet Explorer has been tested as it offers 'pass-through' Windows Authentication by default.</p>

<p>Groups which users can edit and the available users that can be added are gathered from plain text files. These files are generated by the powershell scripts you find here as well. - They require customization to your environment.</p>

<p>For a brief documentation how to configure it, please check:

<p>If you still need support to get the tool running in your requirement, feel free to contact me. :-)</p>
