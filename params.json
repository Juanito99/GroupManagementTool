Simply speaking, a user member of a particular group has permission to a particular resource. \r\nIf a user needs access to a resource the IT department will be contacted which then fulfills the request. \r\n\r\nIn a small environment it only takes a few steps. In bigger companies the it might take several steps more to solve a user's request (Ticket processing, approval handling, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tool helps out. It gives a user a way to update the membership of a group that she is been trusted in 3 steps without contacting IT. - Time saving for the user and for the IT department!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## From user's perspective\r\nA user opens Internet Explorer and navigates to the URL under which the tool has been published. E.g. http://adgmt. The user will be authenticated through windows authentication without keying in password and sees directly which groups she is able to manage:\r\n![ShGroups](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7899808/a168e972-0765-11e5-843d-0a2f3879298e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers of the first group will be shown automatically:\r\n![ShMembers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7902022/89498508-07d9-11e5-8c59-27f66d2314ce.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers can be deleted by selecting and choosing the delete link. New users can be added to the group by typing in a few characters of the new user's name or UserID and adding him with the add-link:\r\n![SearchUsr](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7530740/80ef2252-f580-11e4-8ba7-0683405c3017.png)\r\n![AddUsr](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7530739/80e86a8e-f580-11e4-8077-01472b99e007.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nLast the changes must be committed by clicking the updated-membership link:\r\n![AddOK](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7899809/a174e574-0765-11e5-9010-e49f102a6e96.png)\r\n\r\nA status message will inform if the action succeeded or failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe e-mail link top right corner of the page will sent the group membership of the present displayed group to the user.\r\n\r\n**Multiple language support! According to the browser's language setting the language is selected.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## From IT's perspective\r\nLocate the group you like to delegate to the user / or a user group in Active Directory\r\n![ADgrp1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7903953/2ac6b7b8-081e-11e5-915d-445df268d06b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect the tab 'MangedBy' and specify the user / or user group which should be able to manage the group.\r\nCheck the 'Manager can update membership' checkbox and safe the changes.\r\n![ADGrp2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/7903952/2ac05c92-081e-11e5-872a-901028eb9d63.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tool provides a list of all groups which have the 'managedBy' plus 'Manager can update membership' checked as overview.

The browser's language setting determines the selected language.\r\n![Lang](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11002556/8023275/f76d03a4-0d36-11e5-8e03-8e64ab0ca891.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical Summery\r\nThe software is build in ASP.Net WebForms and requires .Net 4.5.1 framework running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 or higher. \r\nThe server hosting the page must be part of Active Directory. Only Internet Explorer has been tested as it offers 'pass-through' Windows Authentication by default.\r\n\r\nGroups which users can edit and the available users that can be added are gathered from plain text files. These files are generated by the powershell scripts you find here as well. - They require customization to your environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a brief documentation how to configure it, please check:\r\n[HowTo](https://github.com/Juanito99/GroupManagementtool/wiki/How-To)\r\n\r\nIf you still need support to get the tool running in your requirement, feel free to contact me. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Juanito**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
