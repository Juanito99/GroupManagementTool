Simply speaking, a user member of a particular group has permission to a particular resource. \r\nIf a user needs access to a resource the IT department will be contacted which then fulfills the request. \r\n\r\nIn a small environment it only takes a few steps. In bigger companies the it might take several steps more to solve a user's request (Ticket processing, approval handling, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis tool helps out. It gives a user a way to update the membership of a group that she is been trusted to manage. \r\nTime saving for the user and for the IT department!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
